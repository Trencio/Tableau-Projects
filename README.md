## What I Learnt in Tableau over the years: 

1. Data Visualization Techniques: Learning  data visualization techniques such as creating bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, maps, heatmaps, treemaps, and more. Exploring different chart types and  understand how to represent the data effectively.

2. Dashboard Design:  showcasing well-designed dashboards. Being able to  learn how to arrange and organize visualizations, add interactive filters, create navigation elements, and incorporate user-friendly features into my dashboards.

3. Data Preparation and Blending: Learning  how to prepare the data for analysis, including techniques for data cleaning, reshaping, and blending multiple data sources. I also  learned about data joins, data blending, data parsing, and transforming data for better visualization.

4. Calculations and Expressions: Developing an understanding on how to  demonstrate and  create calculated fields, custom formulas, and expressions using Tableau's calculation language. As well as learning  how to perform aggregations, create conditional statements, and define calculated measures to enhance my analysis.

5. Interactivity and Filters: Utilizing interactivity features such as filters, parameters, and actions I  learned how to create dynamic visualizations that allow users to interact with the data and explore different aspects of the analysis.

6. Mapping and Geospatial Analysis: Leaning the key concepts for geospatial analysis by  creating  maps, plot geographic data, and perform spatial analysis. Some of key concepts I learned was  about geocoding, mapping layers, custom map styling, and using spatial calculations.

7. Advanced Analytics: Some of the techniques i used over the years were forecasting, trend analysis, clustering, and statistical calculations. Also learning how to  leverage Tableau's built-in analytical functions or integrate with external statistical tools.

8. Storytelling and Presentation: Using storytelling elements where data visualizations are combined to tell a cohesive story or present insights. This is where i was able to tell  compelling narratives, add annotations, and structures in my analysis for effective communication with stakeholders.
