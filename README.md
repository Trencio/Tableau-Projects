## What I Learnt in Tableau over the years: 

    Advanced charting techniques:
       -  Creating dual-axis charts to compare two measures on different scales (e.g., revenue and profit).
       - Building combination charts with different chart types in a single visualization (e.g., bar chart combined with a line chart).
       -  Using reference lines and trend lines to highlight specific data trends or benchmarks.

    Advanced calculations and formulas:
       - Utilizing level of detail (LOD) expressions to perform calculations at different levels of granularity (e.g., calculating average sales per customer regardless of other dimensions).
       - Implementing table calculations to perform calculations across rows, columns, or panes (e.g., calculating running totals or moving averages).
        - Creating advanced calculations using functions like WINDOW_SUM, RANK, and IF-THEN-ELSE statements.

    Advanced data manipulation:
        - Using data blending to combine data from multiple sources with different schemas (e.g., blending sales data from different regions or databases).
        - Implementing data joins and unions to merge data from different tables or worksheets (e.g., joining customer information with sales data).
        - Applying data pivoting and reshaping techniques to transform data from a wide format to a long format or vice versa.

    Advanced interactivity and user experience:
        - Building interactive dashboards with actions and filters to allow users to explore data dynamically (e.g., filtering a dashboard to show data for specific regions or time periods).
        - Creating parameter controls to enable users to change variables and see the impact on visualizations (e.g., adjusting a parameter to view data for different product categories).
        - Implementing drill-down and hierarchy navigation to provide users with detailed insights at different levels of data granularity (e.g., drilling down from country to city level in a map).

    Performance optimization and data optimization:
        - Utilizing data extracts to improve performance by aggregating and pre-processing data before loading into Tableau.
       -  Applying data source filters and context filters to reduce the amount of data being loaded and processed in visualizations.
